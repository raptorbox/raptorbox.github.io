# UI

A platform is incomplete without its GUI and user \(or developer\) cannot find the true meaning and functionality of it unless he/she tries it. RaptorBox is provided with GUI that gives user the last and most important part to complete a package.

This GUI is designed in state of the art manner that provides most of the functionalities of the platform to make a complete package that a user can use to control his/her devices and perform different type of actions over them. It is designed to give a better view of data visualization with real-time \(live\) updates from the devices. A user can view his/her applications with the users and their roles and can find his devices easily.

The following APIs are fully working with the current version of UI:

1. App
2. Stream
3. Action
4. Inventory
5. Auth
6. Profile \(User profile\)

UI is fully open source based on Vue.JS with the CoreUI theme. A developer can download it and deploy it without thinking about the data visualization softwares. And if user/developer do not like it he/she can create a new UI and use it with the RaptorBox easily.

The online version of RaptorBox can be checked [here](https://v5.raptorbox.eu/#/).
