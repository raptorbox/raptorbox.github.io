# Database and Cache

Database is the most important part in software architecture to keep all the data. Raptor is fully supported to **MongoDB **but flexible to be used with other databases.

Cache in large scale platforms helps to make access to data fast. Raptor is equipped with state of the art caching system based on **Redis **that makes the data access for user fast.

As the RaptorBox is dockerized for all the components, a developer can provide his/her own docker container for MongoDB and Redis other than the default one and can secure it in his/her own ways.
