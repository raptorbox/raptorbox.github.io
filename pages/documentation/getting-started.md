For a quick installation, you only need both Docker and Docker Compose installed on your pc.

See the official Docker guide to install them:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/#/install-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After that to setup a running environment on your pc launch this [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raptorbox/raptor/master/scripts/installer.sh) as root.

Now with the command

``
$ sudo raptor ps
``

you are able to see all the docker processes active.
